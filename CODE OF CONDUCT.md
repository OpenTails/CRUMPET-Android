Code of Conduct
Crumpet, in both iOS and Android versions, are open source community projects about working, as a group, to empower ourselves and others to have control over our own animatronic wearable gear. Just as we hope to increase technological diversity on the Internet through decentralization, we also believe that diverse viewpoints and voices among our community members foster innovation and creative solutions to the challenges we face. Its also more fun!
We are committed to providing a safe, welcoming, and harrassment-free space for collaboration, for everyone, without regard to age, disability, economic situation, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, language fluency, level of knowledge or experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity and orientation, or any other attribute. 

The maintainers of the Crumpet apps share the dual responsibility of leading by example and enforcing these policies as necessary to maintain an open and welcoming environment. All community members should be excellent to each other.

Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all places where the Crumpet app community activity is ocurring, including on GitHub, in discussion forums like Telegram, on social media, and in real life. The Code of Conduct applies not only on websites/at events run by the Crumpet app community (e.g. our GitHub organization) but also at any other location where the Crumpet app community is present.

Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

Using welcoming and inclusive language
Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
Showing empathy towards other community members
Making room for new and quieter voices

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
Trolling, insulting/derogatory/unwelcome comments, and personal or political attacks
Public or private harassment
Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
Aggressive and micro-aggressive behavior, such as unconstructive criticism, providing corrections that do not improve the conversation (sometimes referred to as "well actually"s), repeatedly interrupting or talking over someone else, feigning surprise at someone's lack of knowledge or awareness about a topic.
Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
Retaliating against anyone who reports a violation of this code.
We will not tolerate harassment. Harassment is any unwelcome or hostile behavior towards another person for any reason. This includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments related to personal characteristics or choices, sexual images or comments, deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussion or events, nonconsensual publication of private comments, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention. Conduct need not be intentional to be harassment.

Enforcement
We will remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not consistent with this Code of Conduct. We may ban, temporarily or permanently, any contributor for violating this code, when appropriate.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project lead, Andrew Shoben (@MasterTailer). All reports will be treated confidentially, impartially, consistently, and swiftly.

Because the need for confidentiality for all parties involved in an enforcement action outweighs the goals of openness, limited information will be shared with the Crumpet community regarding enforcement actions that have taken place.
